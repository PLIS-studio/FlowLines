# FlowLines

FlowLines is a small, focused Unreal Editor plugin that improves Blueprint readability by styling **Exec** (execution) pins and wires.  
Use presets (Default / High Contrast / Soft) or pick **Custom** to set your own color, wire thickness and pin size. All controls live in **Editor Preferences** — no project code changes required.
